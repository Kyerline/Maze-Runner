This is a maze runner project written in Python, which includes PyGame to demonstrate the capabilities of pathfinding algorithms.

The goal of the project is to traverse a maze by automated means, in which the path can be blocked by the user if they choose. Blocking the program from reaching its destination shows proof that it knows when its destination cannot be found. 

## PyGame Library Setup
To launch the program, the user will need to have already installed the following prerequisites: 

* [Python 3.10.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* [pip 22.0.4](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

Installation guides can be found below:

To run the program, navigate to the folder and type in the following command:
```
python3 ./pth.py
